# HTML Basics

## Setting up your environment
Before we even get into the HTML, we will need to set up a couple things. First, we'll need to install a code editor to help us write our HTML. Our recommendation is [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). It's a free, open source editor that is very popular and has a lot of features. You can download it from the link above. Though, you are welcome to use any editor you like!

We need to create a folder that will hold all of the site's content, including its HTML file.

1. Create a folder on your computer called **"Cubstart Web"** or whatever you want to name it.
2. Open your text editor of choice in the folder and create a new file. 
3. Save (Ctrl/Command + S) that new file in your "Cubstart Web" folder and name it **index.html**.
    - Think of this as the homepage of your site!
4. **OPTIONAL**: If you want to use your own images on your site, create a new folder within your "Cubstart Web" folder named "**assets**".
    - This "assets" folder is where you can put images from your local computer that you want to display on your site (e.g. a selfie)

At the end of setup, your **Cubstart Web** folder should look something like this:

![](/assets/hw1-setup.png)

# Build Your Own Site

Now that you're all set up, let's get creating!

In this HW, you will be building your first website in HTML using all of the tags and elements we learned in lecture. At the end, you should have a simple site that looks something like the image below.

<img src="/assets/hw1-ex.png" width="600"/>

## Need some help starting your HTML code?

To learn how to code, it's best to do your own work and see yourself write the code to get familiar with the syntax and format :) 

But if you need some help, here's some starter code below:

~~~html
<!DOCTYPE HTML>
<html>
    <head>
    <title> ... </title>
    </head>

    <body>
    ...
    </body>
</html>
~~~

## Requirements for Your Site

To make sure you get the hang of the basics we covered in lecture, we'll be checking your final site for the following tags and elements

- A **title** tag in the HTML `<head>` â†’ Name your site.
- At least 2 sets of **div tags** â†’ Organize your website into sections.
- **Headings** â†’ Let us know what each section is about.
- **Paragraph** tags â†’ What do you have to say about your site?
- An **image** â†’ Spice up your site with some visual elements! ðŸ”¥
    - You can use images from your own computer or from the internet with a url! If you need help, feel free to ask any of the course staff.
- A **link** to a site of your choice â†’ use the `<a>` tags to link your favorite Youtube videos, a Spotify playlist, your social media handles, etc.
    - You can make text or images into a link!

## Viewing Your Site

Want to see what your site looks like in a web browser? 

Double click on the **index.html** file and it should open your page on your default browser! 

If you're viewing your site while you're still making edits, you can refresh the page to see your changes.
    
# Challenge!
Do you know some CSS? We'll be going over how to beautify our website in a later HW, but if you want to challenge yourself and try it out right now, you can look up some resources on CSS and style your website! We're excited to see how creative you can be! :)

If you're looking for some resources to get a headstart, here are some good sites:
- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/css/)
- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS)

# Homework Submission!
To submit the homework folder, you have to zip it first. 

**To zip a folder:**
_**Windows:** Right-click the folder with your HTML and all files like images on your website, select (or point to) Send to, and then select Compressed (zipped) folder._
_**macOS:** Control-click the folder with your HTML and all files like images on your website or tap it using two fingers, then choose Compress from the shortcut menu._

Upload the .zip file to [Gradescope](https://www.gradescope.com/) and you're done!
