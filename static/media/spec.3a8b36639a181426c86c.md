# Final Project Specification

## Minimum Requirements
Your goal is to design and develop a web application that incorporates the following:

1. Content, Structure, and Style (HTML + CSS)
2. Interactivity (JavaScript)
3. An API (whether that be a pre-existing API or a custom server)

Other than that, the final project is very open-ended! Be creative and build anything you want.

If you meet these 3 requirements, then you will pass this course. If you do not meet these minimum requirements but we notice that you've put in substantial effort into the final project and have dedicated time to Cubstart through lecture/lab/OH attendance and homework submissions, then you will also pass!

For those with prior programming/web dev experience, we encourage you to go above and beyond the minimum requirements! Impress us!

## Part 1: Final Project Checkpoint (Project Proposal + Design Mockup)
**Deadline:** Friday, November 10

**Grade:** 10 points

The project proposal and design mockup is how you will flesh out exactly what you want to build over the next couple weeks, identify why you're building it and what tools/skills you need, and receive feedback on the feasibility of your idea.

### Project Proposal
_<b>Action Item:</b> With your project team, submit [this Google Form](https://forms.gle/BjVdnTa2j91xUDWL7) to address each of the following points by Friday, November 10._
- **Group number**

- **Names of each group member**

- **Project Name:** Come up with a cool name for your application!

- **Application Description:** Write a short description of the application that you are looking to build. If it solves a problem, include the description of the problem and how the application approaches it.

- **Features + Tools/Technologies:** Describe the functionalities of the app. For each feature, mention the tools/technologies that you may need to implement this feature.

- **Timeline:** When do you plan to work on certain portions of your project, and in what order? What work will you aim to complete by certain checkpoints? How will you and your group split up the work? Will your group be setting up regular meetings? If so, will they be virtual or in-person?

- **Design Mockup PDF**: Choose one group member to submit a PDF file of your design mockup to [Gradescope](gradescope.com) and add all other team members as collaboraters to the gradescope submission.

### Design Mockup

Use any design tool that you'd like! We recommend Figma.

1. Come up with a design to demonstrate your project idea. Bring your vision to life! Include colors, try different fonts, mess with corner radius or effects like drop shadows. Here is an example.

2. Choose one group member to submit a PDF of your design to Gradescope and add all other team members as collaboraters to the submission.

## Part 2: Final Project Development + Presentation
<b>Deadline:</b> TBD (1 December 2023 OR during dead week), 40 points

On Demo Day, you will present your project to the class! You'll be given **2 minutes to present your project + 1 minute for Q&A.** Walk us through a demo of your project, talk about how you created it, what technologies you used, what roadblocks you came across and how you solved them, what you could improve upon if you had more time, other functionalities that would be cool to implement, etc. You are welcome to create a slide deck if desired. We may give out prizes :)

We will set up a Gradescope assignment to submit your project code.

## Tips + Advice
- Attend Project Office Hours (check the schedule for dates/times). 
- Get started early.
- Collaborate with your group together in person.
- Reference the materials we have provided you (slides, homeworks, recordings, etc).
- Take time to read API documentation.
- Use Postman as a tool to test API endpoints.
- USE THE INTERNET AS A RESOURCE! [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) and [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) are great resources.

We hope to see you make something awesome :)
