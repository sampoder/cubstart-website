## Some Notes on Homework
If you need help with the homework, make a private post on EdStem or pull up to [virtual office hours](https://berkeley.zoom.us/j/3732485321) on Thursdays and Fridays (5.30pm - 6.30pm). Homework for this week onwards will be due on Fridays (Friday in the week after the homework is released).

# CLUE 1
_Sign up for an account on [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/). Generate a new API key, by navigating to your profile and "My API Keys". Your API key will be a string you use in script.js._

# CLUE 2
_Here is the format of the URL for an API call to get coordinates from a location name. Ignore state code, country code, and limit. Try this link: **http://api.openweathermap.org/geo/1.0/direct?q=Berkeley&appid=YOURAPIKEYHERE** after inserting your API key to get the coordinates of Berkeley._
