**Course Designation:** CS 198-075, CS 198-750

**EECS Dept. Sponsor:** Professor John Denero

**Course Catalog:** Fall 2022

## Course Overview

Central to many aspects of software engineering, full stack web development using modern tech stacks is often overlooked by traditional course offerings. The difficulty of acquiring these developmental skillsets is undeniable, especially for those with no prior/limited experience wanting to break into tech. CS 198-75 provides unique weekly guided full-stack projects, mentorship, and technical workshops. The final project of the semester will be dedicated to applying your skills to develop a viable product/application with a team.

## Course Material

The course content is split into lectures, optional labs, homework, and a final project. You are expected to form teams of up to 4 at the start of the semester, who will be your group to navigate homework projects and deliver a final project with.

## Lectures (Thursdays 6-7pm PT)

The weekly lectures are intended to give an introduction to the contents covered by the homework due the following week. The general structure will be a conceptual overview of the highlighted topics, use cases, and real-life examples. Attendance will be recorded.

## Labs (Fridays 6-8pm PT)

The weekly labs serve as a means of introducing the homework assignment (that was assigned the previous week) for those who are struggling to grasp certain concepts or haven't gotten around to doing the assigned homework. Those who do not wish to complete an assignment in its entirety for a certain week, can come to the lab section and attempt the homework for the entire duration. You can receive full credit for the homework assignment regardless of completion (based on effort, TAs will check you off). Labs will be held in Soda 405. You do not need to attend these labs if you feel comfortable that you can complete the homework assignment, or have already completed it.

## Homeworks (Assigned Mondays, Due the Next Friday)

The weekly homeworks are mini-projects that have a detailed, step-by-step spec for you to follow. The way these step-by-step projects have been designed is intended to achieve two things:

Quality: So that you may gain the working knowledge of the relevant technologies
Uniqueness: So that you may have a stand-out project for your resume/portfolio with many talking points
We understand that you have other obligations throughout the semester, which is why we have optional weekly labs on Thursdays, so that you may receive credit for the project the day before it is due (Friday) if you can not commit to a project for a certain week. However, the project spec is instructional enough so that you can follow each step without too much trouble all the way until the finished product, from which you are expected to add a few creative modifications for credit. You are allowed to collaborate your team on these projects, but you are expected to submit these homeworks individually.

## Final Project

The last 4 weeks will be dedicated to your final project, which is ideating and building a viable product/application. You’ll be expected to meet with your project team regularly to work towards meeting the checkpoints throughout. You will have a chance to demo your project for industry experts and professionals as your final at Demo Day, which will take place on Thursday, 5/5. We will be offering extensive Office Hours support as you and your team take on this final project.

## Learning Goals
- Tackling detailed project specs
- Project ideation and developing software in a team
- Achieving full stack web development proficiency

## Grading Breakdown

| **Points** | **Assignment**                          |
| ---------- | --------------------------------------- |

| 5          | Final Project Checkpoint: Design Mockup |
| 40         | Final Project: Demo Day                 |

This course is fast-paced and highly cumulative. Your success will depend on your active and consistent participation. However, we understand that emergencies and personal matters do come up, so you are allowed up to 2 excused and 2 unexcused absences across lectures. Excused absences require at least 6 hours notice; please email cubstart@calhacks.io with the subject line “[CUBSTART] EXCUSED ABSENCE REQUEST - YOUR FULL NAME.” In the body of the email, please include the reason for the request. Absences beyond our limit will automatically result in a grade of NP.

## Late Work

Each student is allowed up to 3 slip days throughout the semester. Slip days are applicable to the homeworks. Each slip day is equivalent to a 24-hour extension. You may use multiple slip days back-to-back. Using a slip day does not require any notice; they will simply be applied at the end of the semester to maximize your overall grade. Slip days will be subtracted from each student on the team at the same time. Outside of slip days, late work will receive a 10% grade deduction for every day after the deadline that the work is submitted.

## Academic Honesty

You may only work with your teams on the projects. Respect licenses of libraries that you use, and do not sabotage other students (there is no curve). Follow UC Berkeley’s Honor Code.
